#Known issues

1. Conditional rendering of "edit routine" and "edit build routine" forms throws unknown error, likely linked to library components. "Edit joke" has old code for comparison.
* Changing 'paper' component background-color
* Removing auth
* Editing jokes on Build page does not re-render joke if its part of that routine (rendered above)
* Needs nav bar for navigation
* Auth needs validation!!!!
